Hey,

Reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravindhar-reddy-vantakapu/)

I am a master's student in Scientific Instrumentation, I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skills. My passion for data science and machine learning has led me to actively develop these abilities over the past five months by attending a Data Science boot camp and have completed 500+ hours of coursework through hands-on projects involving web scraping, SQL, Tableau, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning (ML). My passion for understanding and working with data has only grown stronger and I am excited to explore professional opportunities in data science and machine learning where I can utilize my skills and continue to learn and grow.


## Projects
#### Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization of Safecast Radiation dataset
- Safecast radiation dataset collected from Kaggle containing 3M+ rows & 12 columns
- Merged and Visualized data using Plotly, Folium, Matplotlib to compare radiated countries in the world
- Discovered most radioactive affected areas Fukushima, California due to human errors and natural resources on earth


#### Web Scraping popular 3D printing CAD models details from GRABCAD using Python & Selenium 
- Scraped cad models details from grabcad.com/library using Python, Selenium up to 2 pages
