## Projects
#### Prediction of the flight price using XGBoost regressor machine learning algorithm

- Worked with flight dataset collected from Kaggle containing 300k rows & 13 columns
- Visualized the data and found correlations between features using Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
- Trained the data using the XGBoost regressor algorithm and got an accuracy score of 96.8% for test data


#### Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization of Safecast Radiation dataset
- Safecast radiation dataset collected from Kaggle containing 3M+ rows & 12 columns
- Merged and Visualized data using Plotly, Folium, Matplotlib to compare radiated countries in the world
- Discovered most radioactive affected areas Fukushima, California due to human errors and natural resources on earth


#### Web Scraping popular 3D printing CAD models details from GRABCAD using Python & Selenium 
- Scraped cad models details from grabcad.com/library using Python, Selenium up to 2 pages
- Defined simple functions to parse title, author, likes, etc. And put the data into a list of dictionaries
- Exported data contains 200 rows & 7 columns into Pandas data frame and converted to .CSV file
